/**Que - Maximum Frequency Stack

Solution
Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:

push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].   **/


class FreqStack {
    //array for frequency
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq;// item -> frequency
    //store frequncy -> stack(all items of same frequency..)
    Map<Integer, Stack<Integer>> group;
    int maxfreq;

    public FreqStack() {
        freq = new HashMap();
        group = new HashMap();
        maxfreq = 0;
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        int f = freq.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1;
        freq.put(x, f);
        // points to current highest frequency.. since we do not have PQ sorting..
        if (f > maxfreq)
            maxfreq = f;

        group.computeIfAbsent(f, z-> new Stack()).push(x);
    }

    public int pop() {
        int x = group.get(maxfreq).pop();
        freq.put(x, freq.get(x) - 1);
        // if all elements in frequency empty, then reduce freq.	
        if (group.get(maxfreq).size() == 0)
            maxfreq--;
        return x;
    }
}
